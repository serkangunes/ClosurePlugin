This plugin adds another inspection for javascript files to check whether all the
google closure classes are imported properly.

If the class is not imported it will give an error. It is possible to click on the error statement 
and get a quick fix bubble to auto import those missing classes

Version 1.0.8 of the plugin is still waiting to be approved. This includes imports bug and wildcard bug.
